# The Gridwich Project ðŸŽ†ðŸ¥ª

A framework for stateless workloads (batteries included for video on-demand operations). For more background, see [Gridwich architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/media-services/gridwich-architecture).

## Features

* Stateless workloads allow an arbituary object to flow through each workload. See [Operation context](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/media-services/gridwich-architecture#operation-context).
* Easily customize by hooking [custom Event Grid listeners](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/media-services/gridwich-architecture#gridwich-sandwiches).
* Object logging is integrated with Azure Application Insights. See [Gridwich logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/media-services/gridwich-logging).
* Deployment uses Azure Pipelines and Terraform.

## Getting started

* [Set up the Azure DevOps Project and Azure Pipelines](doc/1-set-up-azure-devops.md).
